# eSpirometer
A microphone based spirometer utilizing an INMP441I2S MEMs microphone, WS2812 indicator LED, and an ESP32 Wroom development board.

## Motivation
Version 1, not included in this git, was originally created for my masters thesis. I am currently updating it to be more efficient, as well as hook to my personal website due to wanting to utlize my website as an access point for additional functionality.
